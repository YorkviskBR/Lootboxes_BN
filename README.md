## How It Works

'Tis the season for giving... to yourself! Using any mobile device and a cash card, you can manifest mysterious, brightly-wrapped gift boxes. The process from purchase to prize is a simple, multi-step flow:

1.  **Crafting:** With a `cash card` (with sufficient funds) and a smart device (`smartphone`, `laptop`, etc.) in your possession, open the crafting menu (`&`). Gift box recipes can be found in the `OTHER` category.
2.  **Purchase:** Crafting a gift box will take 1 minute and consume a certain amount of money from your `cash card`. The corresponding box item will appear in your inventory.
3.  **Placement:** Activate (`a`) the box item from your inventory. This will prompt you to place it on an adjacent tile. The item will be consumed, and a physical gift box will appear on the ground.
4.  **Opening:** The placed box is essentially a static 1 HP object. Attack it with any weapon (or your fists) to destroy it and unwrap your present.
5.  **Loot!:** Upon destruction, the gift box will drop its contents onto the tile it occupied.
